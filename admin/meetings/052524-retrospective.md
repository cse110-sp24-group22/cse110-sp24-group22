### Goal: 
Review the effectiveness of our previous sprint.

### Agenda:
  1. Complete Retrospective

### Retrospective
- Ran a mad, sad, and glad activity to gain a sense of what went wrong and right during the project
  
#### Issues  
##### Lack of Coordination/Communication
- Warren did not know about the Figma that the design team was working on
- Ethan feels that some team members are unresponsive in Slack
- Many felt that various aspects of the projects were unknown to them until the weekly team meetings
- Satvik suggests that we should create a stand-up channel so that everyone is informed of what is going on
- This will be enforced via a stand-up Slack bot which will remind everyone to answer the following questions: \
  1.) Describe what you worked on today (link the issue associated). \
  2.) Describe any decisions you made. \
  3.) If possible, provide an image of anything you have done. 
- This should hopefully keep everyone informed about what has been done in the project on a daily basis and notify everyone of design decisions that were made by a person. 

##### Not Enough Progress
- There were concerns by many people that the development was not going as fast as it should.
- Satvik mentioned that a part of this comes from the sub-team structure that was implemented in the previous sprint. While it worked for the research-heavy tasks, it does not fit the nature of the current work.
- To fix this, Satvik proposed that we use GitHub issues as a task board that anyone can take up rather than be constricted to a certain part of the project (minus the design team).
- A standard issue template is already set, now we will require detailed titles, appropriate labels of what the issue is concerned with, and a priority level.
- Everyone is encouraged to not only assign issues to themselves but also create issues to fill the board.
- This should split more work between more people and increase our production rate
  
#### Organized Work
- Some of us felt that the work was assigned and organized well during the last sprint.
- As mentioned before, Satvik brought up that it fit the work of the previous sprint, but it does not fit the work of the current sprint, so changes were made. 

### Leftover Tasks:
- Create a channel for stand-ups and add a Slack bot
- Make priority tags for issues and solidify the issue finding and assigning process more
