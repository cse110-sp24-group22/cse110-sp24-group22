### Home Page/User Flow Mock-up

- We clarified home page design with members from all teams
- This led to discussions on exactly how the user interacts with the journal and all other windows/screens that should be present
- Esther and Jalen brought up including multiple entries per day for user experience. This was accounted for by linking a day's node to an existing listview screen where a search query is passed in for that day will be made.
- Menu was scrapped due to lack of functionality
- Drew mockup on a white board and will be added to the Miro project board
