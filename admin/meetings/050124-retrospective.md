### Warmup retrospective

- Warren: Better assignment of 

### TA feedback

#### Good things

- TA enjoyed the creativity of the garlic and our choice of idea
- Functionality was good
- Enjoyed Jan's video – his enthusiasm was contagious

#### Bad things

- Suggested instead of individual files in our root folder, we should have a folders for each type of file: a JavaScript folder, an HTML folder, a CSS folder.
- Create unified format for commit messages and issues. Issue template would be good.
- Try to include test scripts, but excusable for warmup. 
- Set format for how we code. Otherwise each of us has our own stylistic choices. We should streamline that and have it not be different.
- Focused on essential features, but she wanted to see more non-essential features.
	- Example: Translation to other languages. Accessibility of our project.
- Timothy: Suggest commit message of the form `[JS/HTML/CSS] <message>`

### Timeline

- Aaron: 2 weeks coding seems like too little!
- Ethan: Define and design can be mixed
- Timothy: We should get coding boilerplate as early as possible
- Finish by May 29
- Design by end of week 6
- Satvik: Market analysis, what makes a good dev journal

### Analysis

- Why would people want to journal?
	- Ethan: To keep memories
	- Warren: Using control-F to find something from a long time ago
	- Keep record of lessons you've learned
	- Reflection and reminders
	- Keep track of progress
	- Ethan: Lonely
	- Random inspiration
- Developer-specific
	- Task list -> separation and progress list into tools
	- Ideas/brainstorming
	- Code integration

#### Problem statements

- How do we incentivize developers to journal? Convenience, aesthetics, usability, gamification

#### Features

- Aaron: Fastest way to record a bug is to scroll it, right click on it (part of the browser extension), or take a screenshot and copy-paste to wherever you want it to be. Anything else, e.g., opening a desktop app, way too slow

- Conveniences
	- Websites (w/extension)
	- Post storage and auto save
	- search bar
	- big + to add journal
	- Voice to text
	- Auto fill
- Usability
	- Minimalistic, reduce buttons
	- Account based, password
