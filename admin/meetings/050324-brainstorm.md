### Agenda

1. Discuss pitch and clarify scope
2. Finish up `pitch.md`

### General discussion

- Pitch slides due Sunday, and we will do the pitch itself on Wednesday
- Finish up the Miro board and export it
	- Use it as a whiteboard as if we were in-person
- Satvik: made mind map for our idea
	- Split it into topics and features branching out of that
- Satvik: How to gamify a journal
	- Warren: Streak of journal entries = points
- Satvik: We should soon define a *scope*
- Ethan: Plants vs. Zombies
- Michael: Each thing is a leaf part of a plant
	- Reflect this visually: Put new things onto a leaf
	- Various ways of presenting the full plant: leaves on branches, indicate completeness/consistency
	- Nice visuals encourage people to journal daily (full-looking branches)
- Timothy: Braille printer
	- Satvik: No
- Ethan: Reverse of text-to-speech
	- Timothy: This is hard to do
- Ethan: Bold, italics, etc.
- Satvik: Bookmarking and pinning?
	- Warren: First one more important
- Frankie: Conversion to PDF/printing

Summary of scope:

- Basic document saving (client-side only, can use `localStorage` for this rather than some insane server-side stuff that we don't know how to do)
- Plant visuals to make journaling a bit more fun. Exact visuals not yet decided
- Streaks
- Easy UI so that creating journal entries is very fast (<=2 clicks from the main screen)
- Conversion to PDF/printing so that journal entries can be physically realized
- Bookmarking and maybe pinning
- Find text

Out of scope:

- Phone-friendliness
- Text-to-speech facilities
- Persistence on the server (simply due to complexity/time constraints)
- Bold and italics (depending on difficulty of implementation)
- References between journal entries
- Sharing of data
- Random inspiration
- Code integration
- Reminders
- Task list

### Worked on pitch.md

- Used Visual Studio Code collaboration
	- Consider a different form of multiplayer collaboration. Merging of changes was unreliable and weird.
- Consult `pitch.md` to see what the changes are

### General comments

- Timothy: Let's get started programming on the stuff that we know will be there
	- Satvik: Ok
