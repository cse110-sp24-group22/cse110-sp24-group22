### Goal: 
Present our successes during the last sprint. 

### Agenda:
  1. Complete Sprint Review
  2. Complete Retrospective
     
### Sprint Review
#### JavaScript Team
- Created a garlic rating system with arrow key functionality
- Hovering displays the number of garlic that would be selected if clicked
- Rates from 1 to 5 with garlic images
- Created a border for the emotional rater to allow the user to know what was selected

#### CSS Team
- Created a universal font and theme for the website
- Utilized sections to aesthetically separate rating systems
- Accounted for varying display sizes and image quality
- Stylized website with consistent color, spacing, and font for accessibility

#### HTML Team
- Established main elements for the website that the CSS team could utilize
- Added a functional submit button to allow the user to know when the form was submitted
- Successfully validated the website through GitHub workflow
- Created main sentiment rating elements.

### Retrospective
- Overall the team's clarity and engagement were fairly high however the mastery was low due to many people coding in a new language.
- Ran a mad, sad, and glad activity to gain a sense of what went wrong and right during the project
#### Issues  
##### Role and Work Clarity
- There was a consensus that there was a lack of time and poor time management along with not enough clarity during the warmup exercise
- Ethan suggested that having better defined roles will help in understanding what is expected to be done and reduce work overlap
- Aaron suggested that restructuring the teams such that it is split by feature rather than language will allow members to have control over everything the feature is affected by rather than being constricted by a language.
- These suggestions led to the new roles defined as follows: \
  Per feature there will be:
  - Design Lead: A design lead will be in charge of managing the progress of the feature assigned to their team. They will schedule meetings if necessary, be aware of upcoming deadlines, and push their team to complete their work. As a lead, they will still affect code development, but they will focus on ensuring work is done on time and be the bridge between stakeholders and other teams.
  - Developer: A developer will handle the bulk of the coding done for the assigned feature. They will adhere to the requests made by the team lead and quality checker, and communicate their reasons for major decisions. They should communicate to the design lead on issues, concerns, and requests.
  - Quality Checker: A quality checker will handle validating and standardizing any code created by the developers through PRs and GitHub actions. They should focus on completing any validations and code reviews before aiding in development. May also be asked to test and find bugs.
- It was discussed that there will, at most, be 3 features being worked on at once with there being 1 Design Lead, 1-2 Developers, and 1 Quality Checker. The number of Developers and Quality Checkers may grow in larger teams.
- Any additional roles that may be required should be requested to the Design Lead first, then to one of the Team Leads.

##### Lack of Time/Poor Time Management
- Another consensus was the lack of time management and the short time that the warmup exercise was done.
- It was agreed that the conditions of the warmup exercise in combination with the team schedule did not allow for much time to be spent on the warmup and larger deadlines were not necessary. However, Aaron pointed out that lack of PAs will severely require us to create and enforce our own deadlines to ensure completion.  
- During the next meeting, a timeline will be created setting soft deadlines for a list of generated processes to ensure completion at each stage.

#### Successes
- It was agreed that our use of GitHub issues and actions was utilized well which allowed for the team to smoothly complete the project.
- We should continue keeping this standard up to avoid major confusion and conflicts with a larger project. 

### Leftover Tasks:
- Create a timeline for the project (Gantt Chart)
- Update everyone with the new role structure
- Begin the brainstorming process
