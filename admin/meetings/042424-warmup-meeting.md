  2. Role assignment (10 min)
  3. List basic features (10 min)
  4. Begin working on widget (1-2 hrs)

### Find a Set Meeting Day:
Found that Wednesdays 7-9pm generally works for everyone present, have to confirm with Jan. Location is still uncertain since the library is not reliable, so suggestions are still being taken. 

### Role Assignment: 
Before this meeting, Satvik proposed the roles to be: code development/debugging, documentation, code reviewing, code tester. However, it was discussed by all members that it would be good to split into the following roles instead: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Assets. They were assigned as followed: 
- HTML - Esther, Jalen, Frankie, Satvik
- CSS - Jan,  Alex, Aaron, Warren  
- Javascript - Ethan, Tim
- Assets: Micheal, Esther

Ethan, Warren, Esther, Jalen, and Frankie volunteered for their positions. The rest was decided by a coin flip between CSS and HTML. For this exercise communication between the groups will just be by a person from a group talking ot another group. 

**Note:** Ethan unconsensually dm'd time :(

### List Basic Features:

#### Essential Features: 
- Some method of rating:
	- Garlic: rotten to fresh for good to bad (inspiration from rotten tomatoes)
	- Voted 8/10, opposers had no concern but wanted additional features like a switch for the case that a different UI causes confusion for users.
- A strict integer 1-5
- A title
- pictures for each rating that is clear to the user
- Some prompt 
- Footnote crediting our team and linking the GitHub

#### Non-essential Features:
- Aaron: considering format on a phone
  - Should the images be reformated from a horizontal line/list to stacked when reducing display size and displayed on a phone?
  - If they should how should it be done?
  - Decided to only worry about laptop/desktop display for now. 
- Ethan: dark mode
- Aaron: a switch for normal vs garlic mode 

### Working on the Widget:

#### Coding Process:
- Aaron is a great quality checker, helped everyone properly use live server and live share for code collaboration and HTML visualization.
- Satvik made issues for every essential feature so that each group has elements to create. 
- Suggestion by Aaron: wrapping prompt and rating around a section tag for css group
- HTML team added a "further details" box (a place for the user to explain their rating if they want) using a text area.
   - CSS team had concerns over formatting this text box; however, it was decided that the CSS team could experiment with it, and if it became too complicated, the text box could be removed.
- (Javascript team add here)

#### Image Creation: 
- Micheal handled most of the drawing, the idea takes inspiration from rotten tomatoes: rotten garlic to pristine garlic
- Esther handled the animation of the images. 
- idea for 5: Micheal thought to use garlic with sunglasses as 5 similar to our logo. Esther proposed for the animation that the sunglasses fall down

### Issues:
Timothy accidentally pushed into the main branch with his version of the HTML, CSS, and Javascript code. This was quickly reverted and a new branch was created for the work his group did.  

### Leftover Tasks:
- Documentation
- SWOT Analysis
- Video for widget
- Widget Completion
