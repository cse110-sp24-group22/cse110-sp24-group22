4. Begin Design Stage

## General discussion

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Definition of "done" code: formatted and functional code
- Definition of "done-done" code: documented, ready-to-merge, tested, fixed-style code 
- Pipeline will not check codestyle
- Teams divided by features
  - Each team will have their own code reviewer
- Final Code Reviewer: Aaron
- Start working on it today
- Tasks: make a diagram, Markdown file, and demonstration video
- Tim and Aaron decided to keep it simple and use Jest and one more for pipeline

### ADR (Architectural Decision Records)
- Write down what the big decision is, who checks the decision, the type of decision, considered options, decision outcome

### Teams for Lab 6
- Jalen and Aaron
- Ethan and Alex 
- Warren and Michael
- Frankie and Timothy 
- Jan, Satvik, and Esther

### Pitch Feedback
- Decided the nonfunctional features to focus on our performance and accessibility (minimum 70 on both based on Lighthouse)
- Get a minimum score of 70 in these two categories.

### Design Stage
- Everyone minus the pipeline team (Aaron + Tim) began working on a rough design of the front page of the website
- Based on the description made on Friday, many people drew out a tree and leaves representing documents
- Satvik used branches as a method of organization, branch = month
- Esther pitched a new idea to flip the current design; instead of a tree with branches to leaves of entries, we implement garlic identity and use the roots of the garlic as the tree, offshoots = branches, root endpoints = leaves
- "Above ground" will be saved for decorative area/place for rewards for the streak, sun contains the streak number, TBD
- Next split into the wireframe team (Esther, Michael, Ethan) and User Flow team (Satvik, Warren, Frankie, Alex, Jalen)
  
#### Wireframe Team
- began working on Figma

#### User Flow Team
- began working on Miro
- decided on how layers of the website, found that most actions can be done on the front page, the website will have more breadth rather than depth -> minimalism
- the second layer is the text editor

### Leftover Tasks
- CI/CD pipeline
- User Flow
- Wireframes
- Review Github file naming, commit/error template, clean repository,
