# Gamify Method

## Context and Problem Statement
We decided one way to incentivize devs to journal was by gamifying the process of journaling. A main agreed upon aspect of our gamification was that there would be in-app currency that could be spent on decorations. There were two proposed ideas for the method of getting that currency: 
   1. Users get in-app currency from writing journal entries.
   2. Users get in-app currency from maintaining a consecutive streak of days that they have written journal entries.

We decided to use one of these methods.

## Considered Options

* In-app currency from writing journal entries
* In-app currency from maintaining a streak

## Decision Outcome
We have decided to go with "In-app currency from maintaining a streak" because of a few factors:
  1. It incentivizes the user to be a more consistent journaler, and journaling is often a daily practice
  2. Psychologically, getting to a big number feels rewarding. Including a streak means that there will be a number that can always increase. We want the user to spend their currency, so currency can't be that continual big incentivizing number.
