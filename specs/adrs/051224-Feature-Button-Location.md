# Feature Button Location 

## Context and Problem Statement
When users were on our home page, we needed to consider how they would be able to navigate to what they wanted to. This included features like viewing past entries, creating a new entry, and other features. We wanted to incorporate the gamify feature and overall aesthetics without compromising the user experience. Two options we considered were
   1. Having navigational buttons at the top of the page so users would see them right away
   2. Incorporating the buttons within the tree structure and just having the gamify feature on the front page. 
   
## Considered Options

* Home Page Buttons on top of the tree
* Incorportaed buttons within tree

## Decision Outcome
We decided to have the buttons directly on the home page
  1. The point of a journal is to make is easy for the user to be able to quickly add and go back to features. Similar to a physical journal, we believe having to scroll past aethetical aspects of the page, while nice to look at, would be overall a net negative.
  2. Not having easy access to viewing and writing features of the journal could discourage developers from wanting to use the journal. 
  3. Ease of use and intuitive design should come before aethetics/theme. Having first time users have to learn that the buttons were incorporated in a tree could confuse and discourage them from trying out the journal.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Front Page Buttons
- Good: Obvious and intutive location
- Good: Fast access to journal features
- Bad: Could detract from overall tree/leaf theme
- Bad: Could seperate gamify from journal use, making the rewards feel less appealing

### Incorporates Feature Buttons within Tree
- Good: Ties in functionality with the tree theme
- Good: Leaves more emphasis and focus on gamify features above the tree
- Good: Makes journaling experience more unique and exciting
- Bad: May be confusing for users to have to scroll down and find a feature
- Bad: New users may find it confusing where to access journal features
