# General Landing Page Design

## Context and Problem Statement
We have been deciding as a team how the aesthetics of the journal should look like. There were two proposed ideas: 
   1. Journal entries are called leaves and they are added to a tree that represents the journal as a whole
   2. The journal is represented as branching roots where tips of root offshoots are entries. 
   
There is an argument for either idea, so we must decide which design idea would fit with our concept better. 


## Considered Options

* Tree Journal
* Garlic Root Journal

## Decision Outcome
We have decided to go with the Garlic Root Journal because of 3 main factors: 
  1. It retains the general idea of "growing" a journal, instead of a tree it is roots as well as the nature theme. 
  2. It reserves room "above ground"/above the journal to add in any gamify features and rewards (i.e. its a playground for the user where they are able to add their rewards from keeping a streak)
  3. It fits the team identity much more closely.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Tree Journal
- Good: Retains nature themes and incorporates journal elements
- Good: Visually appealing to users
- Good: Allows for more creativity when naming elements of a journal that tie into parts of a tree. 
- Neutral: Not too creative
- Bad: Difficult to incorporate reward system and decide how it should affect the aesthetic
- Bad: Loosely ties to team identity 

### Garlic Root Journal
- Good: Closely ties into team identity
- Good: Much more creative
- Good: Naturally allows for room "above ground" for gamify features
- Good: Retains nature themes and incorporates journal elements in a creative way
- Good: Is simpler to design and code when compared to the Tree Journal
- Neutral: May be off putting for users at first.
