# Purpose

- Making good habits of recording anything the developers do on their end.
- Encourage developers and other shut-ins to journal more.
- Make journaling a fun experience while still allowing plenty of personal expression and reflection. Adapt the amount of ***scaffolding*** commensurately with how emootionally stunted the developer is.
    - Scaffolding: Features meant to encourage people to journal and journal thoughtfully.
- Allow developers to remember random bolts of brilliance.
# Risks

- Excessive complexity, features which no one will ever use despite considerable developer effort
    - Example: Facebook's Metaverse
- Poor performance after a few hundred journal entries, making the journal 
- Could be too annoying to use. Time from entry into the app to being able to write an entry should be a few seconds, two clicks-or less. Otherwise people are lazy and will instead watch TikTok Is this text better
- Weird
- People have no attachment to the plant gamification
- People may dislike certain aesthetics being locked behind currency rather than being readily available from the getgo.
- User preferences, once the user found it features are not too useful, they will not use this again. 

# Scope
- Plant gamification: whole set of entries is a plant, entries are leaves. You grow the plant by adding more entries.
- Basic document editing features including styling
- Convenience: fast, basic saving features, search, bookmarking



# User Personas
- Bob is a CS student that frequently finds himself wanting to refer back to previous code or solution he implemented. Currently, he goes through past directories/repositories but finds the overall search process frustrating and repetitive after doing it multiple times. He wishes there was a convienient place to access his past work, along with his own thoughts. As of now, he is unable to find a product that caters torwards software developers,
 where code and journal entries can be bundled together.
