# Purpose

- Making good habits of recording anything the developers do on their end.
- Provide a medium for developers to maintain organization of their work.
- Encourage developers and other shut-ins to journal more.
- Make journaling a fun experience while still allowing plenty of personal expression and reflection. Adapt the amount of ***scaffolding*** commensurately with how emootionally stunted the developer is.
    - Scaffolding: Features meant to encourage people to journal and journal thoughtfully.
- Allow developers to remember random bolts of brilliance.

# Risks
- Excessive complexity: features which no one will ever use despite considerable developer effort
    - Example: Facebook's Metaverse
- Poor performance: after a certain number of journal entries, making the journal inefficient
- Usage difficulty: time from entry into the app to being able to write an entry should be within a few seconds and two or fewer clicks
  - Otherwise, it may result in frustration which drives people away from journaling
- Quirkiness may not appeal to certain audiences
- People may have no attachment to the plant gamification
- People may dislike certain aesthetics being locked behind currency rather than being readily available from the getgo
- User preferences: once the user found certain features to be less useful than they deem, they may become less loyal to the app

# Scope
- Plant gamification: the whole set of entries is a plant with entries being leaves. The plant "grows" as users add more "leaves"
- Basic document editing features including styling, choosing fonts, aligning texts, etc.
- Convenience: fast, basic features: saving, search, bookmarking, etc.

# User Personas
- Bob is a CS student that frequently finds himself wanting to refer back to previous code or solution he implemented. Currently, he goes through past directories/repositories but finds the overall search process frustrating and repetitive after doing it multiple times. He wishes there was a convienient place to access his past work, along with his own thoughts. As of now, he is unable to find a product that caters torwards software developers, where code and journal entries can be bundled together. 
- Fiona is a software engineer intern who is getting first exposed to the industry or professional experience. Despite the guidance from mentors, she realizes that there is a lot less hand-holding in the industry. She needs to keep track of the work she has done and any difficulties she has come across, and report to her supervisors to show that she is a worthy candidate for a return offer. 
- Kevin is a junior software engineer who works in a team in creating an app for his company. Being a novel worker, he is unfamiliar about a lot of things and are often overwhelmed due to the scale of the projects. He needs to keep track of the things he does every day and any challenges he faces and bring them up during daily stand-up meetings. 
- Micayla is a senior software engineer who is overseeing a huge development project of her company and leading a team of her own. While producing and testing code, she also needs to provide guidance and mentorship to those in her team who are less experienced than her. She also needs to keep track of the stages of the project and identifies the tasks needed to be done. During frequent meetings with her supervisors, she needs to report the progress of her team. 
- Joe is a CS professor at a world-renowned university. Apart from teaching several classes with varying difficulties, he also has his own research project. Preparing for lectures, writing exams, making progress in his research, writing papers, and traveling to conferences are what constitute his overwhelming schedule. He needs a good journal to keep track of his daily tasks so he doesn't get drowned within them.
