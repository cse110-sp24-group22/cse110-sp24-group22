# Purpose

- Making good habits of recording anything the developers do on their end.
- Provide a medium for developers to maintain organization of their work.
- Encourage developers and other shut-ins to journal more.
- Make journaling a fun experience while still allowing plenty of personal expression and reflection. Adapt the amount of ***scaffolding*** commensurately with how emootionally stunted the developer is.
    - Scaffolding: Features meant to encourage people to journal and journal thoughtfully.
- Allow developers to remember random bolts of brilliance.

# Risks
- Excessive complexity: features which no one will ever use despite considerable developer effort
    - Example: Facebook's Metaverse
- Poor performance: after a certain number of journal entries, making the journal inefficient
- Usage difficulty: time from entry into the app to being able to write an entry should be within a few seconds and two or fewer clicks
  - Otherwise, it may result in frustration which drives people away from journaling
- Quirkiness may not appeal to certain audiences
- People may have no attachment to the plant gamification
- People may dislike certain aesthetics being locked behind currency rather than being readily available from the getgo
- User preferences: once the user found certain features to be less useful than they deem, they may become less loyal to the app

# Scope
- Plant gamification: the whole set of entries is a plant with entries being leaves. The plant "grows" as users add more "leaves"
- Basic document editing features including styling, choosing fonts, aligning texts, etc.
- Convenience: fast, basic features: saving, search, bookmarking, etc.

# User Personas
- Bob is a CS student that frequently finds himself wanting to refer back to previous code or solution he implemented. Currently, he goes through past directories/repositories but finds the overall search process frustrating and repetitive after doing it multiple times. He wishes there was a convienient place to access his past work, along with his own thoughts. As of now, he is unable to find a product that caters torwards software developers, where code and journal entries can be bundled together. 
- Fiona is a software engineer intern who is getting first exposed to the industry or professional experience. Despite the guidance from mentors, she realizes that there is a lot less hand-holding in the industry. She needs to keep track of the work she has done and any difficulties she has come across, and report to her supervisors to show that she is a worthy candidate for a return offer. 
- Kevin is a junior software engineer
- Micayla is a senior software engineer 
- Joe is a CS professor
